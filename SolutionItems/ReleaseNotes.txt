-------------

Version: 0.9.26.0
Release Date: June 17, 2009

New features:
-ExpressionOptions.RealLiteralDataType: Specify the data type used to store real literals
-Decimal literals (ie: 123.45M + 3.45M)
-Optimization: A number raised to a constant integral power (ie: num1 ^ 2) will be optimized to a sequence of multiplications instead of a call to the Pow function

Breaking Changes:
-The result of the power operator is now of the same type as its first argument.  Example: 100 ^ 2 will return an integer; 1.5 ^ 2 will return a double.  Previously, the power operator always returned a double.
